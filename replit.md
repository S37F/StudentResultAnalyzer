## System Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application framework
- **UI Components**: Interactive dashboards with charts, file upload interfaces, and user authentication forms
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts and graphs
- **Layout**: Wide layout with expandable sidebar for navigation

### Backend Architecture
- **Application Layer**: Main application logic in `app.py` with modular components
- **Authentication**: Simple file-based authentication system using JSON storage
- **Data Processing**: Pandas-based data manipulation and analysis
- **Analytics Engine**: Custom analytics classes for performance calculations
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn based ML models for clustering and regression analysis

### Data Storage
- **Primary Storage**: File-based JSON storage for user data and authentication
- **Data Format**: Pandas DataFrames serialized to JSON for persistence
- **File Support**: CSV and PDF file parsing capabilities
- **Session Management**: Streamlit session state for user authentication and data caching

## Key Components

### Authentication System (`auth.py`)
- File-based user management with JSON storage
- SHA256 password hashing for security
- User registration and login functionality
- Simple user profile management

### Database Manager (`db.py`)
- In-memory database with JSON persistence
- DataFrame serialization/deserialization
- User-specific data isolation
- Automatic data loading and saving

### Analytics Engine (`analytics.py`)
- Performance calculation algorithms
- SGPA trend analysis
- Multi-semester data aggregation
- Statistical performance metrics

### Visualization System (`visualizations.py`)
- Plotly-based interactive charts
- SGPA trend visualization
- Subject-wise performance charts
- Responsive chart design with error handling

### Machine Learning Models (`ml_models.py`)
- K-means clustering for performance grouping
- Linear regression for SGPA prediction
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Standardized data preprocessing

### Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- CSV file parsing and validation
- PDF file processing capabilities
- Data cleaning and standardization
- Export functionality for reports

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users log in or register through the auth system
2. **Data Upload**: Students upload CSV or PDF files containing academic results
3. **Data Processing**: Files are parsed, validated, and converted to standardized DataFrames
4. **Data Storage**: Processed data is stored in user-specific JSON files
5. **Analytics**: Performance analytics are calculated from the stored data
6. **Visualization**: Charts and graphs are generated using Plotly
7. **ML Analysis**: Machine learning models provide insights and predictions
8. **Export**: Results can be exported as PDF reports

## External Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for the user interface
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualization library

### Machine Learning
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing
- **Clustering and Regression**: K-means, Linear Regression, PCA

### File Processing
- **PDFplumber**: PDF text extraction and parsing
- **ReportLab**: PDF report generation
- **CSV Processing**: Built-in pandas CSV handling

### Authentication & Storage
- **Hashlib**: Password hashing (SHA256)
- **JSON**: Data serialization and user management
- **OS/IO**: File operations and data persistence

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Single-file deployment with Streamlit
- File-based storage for simplicity
- No external database dependencies
- Self-contained authentication system

### Production Considerations
- **Database Migration**: Can be extended to use PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Can be upgraded to use OAuth or JWT tokens
- **File Storage**: Can be migrated to cloud storage (S3, etc.)
- **Scaling**: Modular design allows for easy component upgrades

### Security Features
- Password hashing for user authentication
- Session-based user isolation
- Input validation for uploaded files
- Error handling for data processing

### Performance Optimizations
- Session state caching for user data
- Efficient DataFrame operations
- Lazy loading of analytics results
- Modular chart generation

The architecture is designed to be simple yet extensible, making it easy to add new features like additional chart types, more sophisticated ML models, or integration with external APIs for enhanced functionality.
